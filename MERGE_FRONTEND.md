# Merging Frontend Repository Guide

Once you provide the lovable repository URL or branch name, I can help merge them. Here's what will happen:

## Option 1: Merge from Remote Branch (Recommended)

If the lovable frontend is on a branch in the same repository:

1. Fetch the branch from GitHub
2. Create a `frontend/` directory
3. Copy frontend files into it
4. Commit and push

## Option 2: Clone and Copy

If it's a separate repository:

1. Clone the lovable repo to a temporary location
2. Copy frontend files into `frontend/` directory in this repo
3. Clean up temporary clone
4. Commit and push

## What I Need From You

- The GitHub repository URL (if separate repo), OR
- The branch name (if same repo)

Example:
- `https://github.com/shaansriram8/lovable-frontend.git` (separate repo)
- OR branch name: `lovable-frontend` (same repo)
